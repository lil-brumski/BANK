# BANK

A banking system that I made using C++.

1. It has a database-like feature that stores the user's account balance even after they close "bank.cpp" file. The database is the "bank.db" file that's in this repository.

2. All three files (bank.hpp, bank.cpp & bank.db) must be in the same directory that you are testing the .cpp file.

3. You don't need to know C++ to test this project. 

   a. Just open the bank.cpp file and run the code in an IDE.

   b. Or run *clang++ bank.cpp -o bank.o* in any C++ compiler and then enter "./bank.o".

4. To get this project on your device, use a terminal or command line and type: *git clone https://github.com/lil-brumski/BANK.git*.

5. Go to the JOB folder to see what it's about.
