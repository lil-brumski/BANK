# BANK

A banking system that I made using C++.

1. It has a database-like feature that stores the user's account balance even after they close "bank.cpp" file. The database is the "bank.txt" file that's in this repository.

2. All three files (bank.hpp, bank.cpp & bank.txt) must be in the same directory that you are testing the .cpp file.

3. You don't need to know C++ to test this project. 

a. Just open the bank.cpp file and run the code in an IDE.

b. Or run *clang++ bank.cpp -o bank.o* in any C++ compiler and then enter "./bank
o".
